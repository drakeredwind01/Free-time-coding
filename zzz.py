the moderators have reviewed your behavior.
They were shocked at your appauling atitude and refusal to listen to reason
they don't like, want, nor know how to handle the more extreme cases when it comes to unruly behavior/conduct
I have had to deal with many in my many years of being a moderator within different orginizations.
I didn't act as a true moderator should act last time because I didn't yet know my place nor the mission of the meetup
I have since then caught up on both and have been given leave to handle situations as I see fit
and I also hope that in the future that if you have any discrepinsies you will ask for a side bar or wait until after the meeting for discuttion.

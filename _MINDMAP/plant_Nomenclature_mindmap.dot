/* This is a co-authorship graph. Each node is an author and an edge exist between two authors if their name appears in a paper on one of the International Symposium on Graph Drawing bwteeen 1994-2007. The top 8 connected components is taken, and the graph is laidout using sfdp, and a map showing the clustering relationship is generated using gvmap with command:

gvmap  -e gd_1994_2007.gv | neato -Ecolor="#55555522" -n2 -Tpng > gd_1994_2007.png

This graph already has coordinates assigned and overlap removed. For a graph not yet laidout, use a layout engine with a suitable overlap removal algorithm, e.g.,

sfdp -Goverlap=prism

first before feeding the output to gvmap.

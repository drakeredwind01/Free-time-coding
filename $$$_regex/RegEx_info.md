re.sub(): This function substitutes occurrences of a pattern in a string with a replacement string.

cleaned_text = re.sub(r"^\d+:\d+\n", "", text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
`r"^\d+:\d+\n"`: This is the regular expression pattern.  Let's analyze it piece by piece:

`^`: anchor matches beginning of a line (because of the re.MULTILINE flag).
`\d+`: matches one or more digits (0-9). The + means "one or more".
`:`: literally matches colon character.
`\d+`: matches one or more digits.
`\n`: matches newline character. crucial to remove entire line.
`""`: replacement string. matched with an empty string, to delete them.

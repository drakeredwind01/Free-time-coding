jurnal log long string of numbers 20241227T110931Z
it's been so long since the onset of this first bit of code
it was supposed to be a simpple script
1. i highlight some text 
2. hit shift+q
3. then it stores the text into a log
4. and shows me at the bottom of the screen that it worked and 
5. what it copied

it shouldn't have blown up like this
it shouldn't have taken this long
it shouldn't have crushed me this hard

>- hey cool it worked the first time. 
>- but that's it also ran "def show_subscribe_window" even though it's inside another fuction and it's supposed to be held back by a loop...
>- oh well i'm sure it won't take long to get this working
>- FORESHADOWING

>- it's insane I tried to write down a file only for the hotkey logic
>- and import the working script and surly it would work right?
>- WRONG!
>- why do keyboard and tinkter hate each other so much!?!
>- are they in a blood feud or something?

IT WORKED ALL THIS TIME
pycharm was blocking the fuction of tkinter
